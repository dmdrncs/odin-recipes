            <p>An easy breaded shrimp recipe. A wonderful appetizer for a family dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>4 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Working one at a time, dip shrimp into beaten egg, allowing any excess egg to drip back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded shrimp, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
